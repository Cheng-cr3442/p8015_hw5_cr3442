## Problem 1

  
First simulate random birthdays and check for duplicate birthdays.  

``` r
# Simulate random birthdays and check for duplicates
birthday_simulation <- function(n) {
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  return(any(duplicated(birthdays)))
}
```

  
Then use functions to simulate the probability that at least two people
in multiple groups have the same birthday.  

``` r
set.seed(123) # Ensure reproducibility
group_sizes <- 2:50
results <- sapply(group_sizes, function(n) {
  mean(replicate(10000, birthday_simulation(n)))
})
```

  
At last we output Image.  

``` r
# Plot the probability as a function of group size
plot(group_sizes, results, type = "o", xlab = "Group Size", ylab = "Probability",
     main = "Relationship Between Group Size and Probability")
```
